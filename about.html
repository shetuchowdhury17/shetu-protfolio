                my family and friends. And I want to be a happy person and to keep happy
                other people around me. . Trying to develop my skill on web developing
                side. I would like to learn some language (E.g English, Chinese, Italian
                & Russian). Travelling, gaming & watching movies are pleasure for me.

                brothers. My two elder brothers are married and I have a cute niece in
                my family. Now she is the younger family member in my home and we are
                really blessed for the beautiful gift from Allah.
